#Caesar Cipher Task
It is the earliest and simplest method for encryption technique in which  each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

#Process
Step 1: Went through the problem in CS50. Watched the video in CS50. The steps involved:

    1.1 To get the key: 'arg' which takes an integer(the number of argument) and 'argv' which takes a string(list of arguments).
    1.2 Get the plaintext
    1.3 Encipher: Formula used: (p+k)%26, where 'p' is the number assigned to the alphabet and 'k' is shift in the alphabet.
    
 Step 2: Watched video related to caesar coding for reference.

 Step 3: On the basis of my understanding i wrote the program.
